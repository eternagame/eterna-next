# @eternagame/design-system-tokens

We store our design decisions in __design tokens__. Design tokens are standardized representations of design choices (like color, font family, etc) in a standard JSON format that allows different tools and languages to consume them. Our JSON format is that used by [Tokens Studio](https://tokens.studio/), which allows us to use our tokens while designing in Figma.

This repo has a `token-transformer` package for scripts to convert the design tokens to specific languages.
